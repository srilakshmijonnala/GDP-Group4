In a wholesale system code, the default items in bulk typically refer to the initial inventory or products that are available for sale when the system is first set up. These items are often added to the system as part of the system configuration or database seeding process. Here's a simplified example of how you might include default items in bulk in a Python-based wholesale system code using a list of dictionaries.
# Define a list of default items in bulk
default_items = [
    {
        'product_id': 1,
        'product_name': 'Widget A',
        'quantity_available': 100,
        'unit_price': 10.99
    },
    {
        'product_id': 2,
        'product_name': 'Widget B',
        'quantity_available': 50,
        'unit_price': 7.99
    },
    # Add more items as needed
]

# Function to initialize the wholesale system with default items
def initialize_wholesale_system():
    # Insert the default items into the database or inventory system
    for item in default_items:
        insert_item_into_database(item)

# Function to insert an item into the database or inventory system (to be implemented)
def insert_item_into_database(item):
    # Code to insert the item into the database goes here
    # This could involve SQL queries, API calls, or other database operations

# Example of how to call the initialization function
initialize_wholesale_system()
