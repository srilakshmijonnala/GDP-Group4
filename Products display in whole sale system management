Managing a wholesale system  involves various tasks and processes involved in buying and selling large quantities of products. An important part of this system is the efficient presentation of products to simplify the ordering and management process. Products can be displayed in the admin settings of the wholesale system as follows: 
 
 1. **Catalog Management:** 
 - Create a comprehensive list of all available products. It should include detailed information about each product, such as name, description, SKU (stock unit), price, quantity available and any applicable discounts or promotions.  
 2. **Classification :** 
 - Organize products into categories and subcategories to make it easier for big shoppers to find what they're looking for. For example, you can classify products by type, brand or industry.  
 3. **Images and description:** 
 - Provide high quality images  with detailed descriptions for each product. Clear, high-resolution images and informative descriptions can help buyers make informed decisions. 
 4. **Prices and discounts:** 
 - Display  wholesale prices of products. Also, if you offer big discounts or special price tiers, make those discounts visible to encourage larger orders. 
 5. **Ad distribution tracking:** 
 - Show product availability in real time or near real time. Buyers need to know if a product is in stock or on backorder so they can effectively manage their inventory. 
 6. **Search functions:** 
 - Implement a powerful search function that allows users to search for products by name, SKU, category or any other relevant attribute. This helps shoppers find what they need quickly.
 7. **Filters and sorting:** 
 - Provide options for buyers to filter and sort products according to various criteria such as price, availability, popularity or brand.  
 8. **Minimum Order Quantities (MOQ):** 
 - If you have minimum orders for certain products, clearly state them in the product details to avoid  confusion.  
 9. **Bulk Order Options:** 
 - Let shoppers easily add multiple items to cart. Provide tools for bulk orders, such as CSV file uploads or quantity aggregators. 
 10. **Product variations:** 
 - If products have varieties (eg different sizes, colors), clearly show those options  and let buyers choose the varieties they want.  
 11. **Product Reviews and Ratings:** 
 - Add customer reviews and ratings where appropriate to build trust and provide social proof for your products.  
 12. **Responsive Design:** 
 - Ensure that your wholesale system management platform is accessible across multiple devices, including desktops, tablets and smartphones.  
 13. **Security and Authentication:** 
 - Implement secure login and authentication measures to protect sensitive wholesale pricing and account information.  
 14. **Order history and tracking:** 
 - Give buyers access to  order history and order tracking information so they can track the status of their purchases. 
 15. **Customer support:** 
 - Provide customer support contact information or  chat  to help buyers with  questions or problems. 
 16. **Configuration Options:** 
 - Depending on your business, consider offering customization options for certain products and let buyers customize their order. 
 Keep in mind that the specific features and functions of a wholesale management system  will depend on your business model, your industry, and the needs of your customers. Update and improve your product display system regularly to improve user experience and meet changing market demands.
