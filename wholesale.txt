To add bulk items to a cart in a wholesale system, you typically need a user interface and backend functionality to manage the selection and storage of items. Below are the general steps to implement a "Add to Cart" feature for bulk items in a wholesale system:
front end (Functionality):

Product Selection: Display a list of bulk items available for purchase with options for quantity and pricing per unit.

Quantity Selection: Allow users to select the quantity of each bulk item they want to add to their cart. This can be done using input fields, drop-down lists, or other UI elements.

Add to Cart Button: Provide an "Add to Cart" button or similar action-triggering element next to each bulk item.

Cart Summary: Display a cart summary, including the list of items added, quantities, and total cost. This should update in real-time as users add items to the cart.

Backend (Functionality):

Data Structure: Maintain a data structure to store the contents of the user's shopping cart. This can be done using a database, session management, or other data storage methods.

Add to Cart Logic: When a user clicks "Add to Cart," capture the selected bulk item, its quantity, and any other relevant information.

Update Cart: If the item is already in the cart, update the quantity. If not, add it as a new item in the cart data structure.

Calculate Total: Recalculate the total cost of the items in the cart whenever an item is added or its quantity is updated.

Persist Data: If necessary, store the cart data between sessions so users can continue shopping later.

Checkout: Implement a checkout process that allows users to review their cart, make changes if needed, and complete the purchase.
