Checking order history in a wholesale system involves multiple steps, including data storage, retrieval, and presentation to users. Here are the key steps to implement order history functionality in a wholesale system:
Order History Retrieval:

Develop methods or queries to retrieve order history data from the database. You can use SQL or an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework like Hibernate or JPA to interact with the database.
Allow users to filter and search for orders based on criteria such as customer name, order date, order status, etc.
