How to  Maintain the details of customer for wholesale Application

You must design a user interface (UI) for entering and presenting customer information as well as the necessary functionality to save and retrieve this data in order to preserve client details in an Android wholesale application. I'll give a high-level summary of the procedures for updating client information in your Android app below:
Database Setup:
To keep track of consumer information, you'll need a database. For local storage, Android offers SQLite, but for cloud storage, it offers a remote database (like MySQL, Firebase, or a custom API). To save client data, you must set up your database tables.
Create  a User Interface(UI):
Create the UI screens to manage customer information. For jobs like the following, you could need activities or fragments:
1)acquiring new clients
2)seeing client information
3)modifying client data
4)deleting clients
5)Performing a customer search or filter
For these screens, create XML layout files to specify the user interface elements (such as text fields, buttons, and lists) and user interactions.
Implement Data Entry  and Retrieval:
Implement the logic for adding, modifying, deleting, and retrieving customer data in your Android application. Typically, this entails:
1)taking care of user input to gather customer data.
2)data integrity is ensured by validating user input.
3)modifying, adding, or removing database records.
4)retrieving consumer data from the database with a query.
Display Customer Information:
Depending on your app's design, implement screens to show client information in either a list view or a detail view. You may use RecyclerView for displaying lists of customers and pass customer details to a detail view when a customer is selected.
Search and Filtering:
Give users the ability to look up or filter clients using different criteria, such as name, email, or customer ID. Apply the appropriate logic for searching and filtering.
Data Security:
Whether it is being stored locally or remotely, make sure that customer data is stored securely. Implement access controls, encrypt sensitive data, and adhere to best practices for data security.
User Athentication:
Implement user authentication to restrict access to client data if your wholesale application uses user accounts. Only authorized users should be able to view or modify customer details.
Regular Backups:
Implement a backup and recovery system to guard against data loss in the event of unforeseen circumstances. Back up customer data frequently to a safe location.
Testing and Valdation:
Test your application thoroughly to make sure that consumer data is handled properly. Validate data entry, perform database actions, and retrieve data, among other scenarios.
The actual implementation will depend on your unique requirements and the design of your wholesale application; keep in mind that this is only a high-level overview. Additionally, take into account utilizing libraries or frameworks like Room for database management and RecyclerView for showing lists of customers that can streamline UI development and database operations.
